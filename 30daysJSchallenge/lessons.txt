    CSS properties
        transform-origin: 100%
        transform: rotate(90deg)
        transition: all 0.05s;
        transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.1, 2.7, 0.58, 1)


general
    Primitive data types are inmutable
    example:
        var a = 10
        var b = a

        a = 5
        
        a // 5
        b // 10 

    so b is still 10 because it copied the value of a by value, not by reference
